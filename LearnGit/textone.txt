1. for the very first we have to create one empty folder
2. then check for "git status" ( it doesn't show main or master branch)
  "git status is the command we are going to run everytime to check the status of repo"
3. because we haven't initialized our repositiory
4. so we have to run "git init" to initialize it
   " git init" is the command run only once at starting of repositiory.

5. after that we have to create files (touch textone.txt is the first empty file is created)
6.  then we need to follow the sequence 
    
    git add --> git commit --> git push

7. "git add ./ " - it will add all the files 
git add. it will add only single file
